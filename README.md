# Glotus_Final

Mobile application integrated with 1C:ERC via Rest interface Odata. 

### How it works
The php script on the server takes encoded data from mobile application as an input, decodes it, and sends decoded data to the 1C.

### Information security
Data which is collected by mobile application is protected since it is encoded before being sent to the server.
